Craft Package Manager
=====================

_This fork is focused on experimental features and ideas._

Craft is a next-generation package manager targeted at Unix-like operating systems.
It is written in Python, supporting both Python 2.4+ and 3.X.

Its main concerns are, in order:
- _Security and correctness_: the user should know his system is in a good state at all times. Upgrading and downgrading should be easy. Corner cases should be easily treatable.
- _Features_: proper multi-architecture support, package groups, meta-packages, package definition inheritance, high customisability, support for mixing different package branches(pinning).
- _User-friendliness_: the command line interface should be very straightforward and easy to use.
- _Performance_: things should be fast, but not while sacrifing any of the above.

If you have any suggestions or questions, feel free to drop us a message.
